MEGA Web client
=====

MEGA provides robust cloud storage with convenient and powerful always-on privacy. MEGA believes in your right to privacy and provides you with the technology tools to protect it. We call it User Controlled Encryption, or UCE, and it happens automatically.

Secure Boot
-----

secureboot.js loads all the resources from static content servers and verifies its authenticity by checking the cryptographic hash.

*Please note that this is not the exact same secureboot.js as we have online at https://mega.co.nz/secureboot.js. We have an automatic process that generates secureboot.js with its cryptographic hashes and all the versioned resource files (file_X.js / file_X.html) as needed based on this respository before prior to updating the live site.*

During development it's essential that your set the following localStorage parameters:
```
localStorage.staticpath = 'http://localhost/mega/';    // path of your local development host
localStorage.dd = 1;	// disables the cryptographic hash verification logic
```
There are also various other localStorage parameters that are useful during development:
```
localStorage.d = 1;		// enables logging
localStorage.contextmenu = 1;	// allows you to disable the contextmenu in the FM for element inspection
```
